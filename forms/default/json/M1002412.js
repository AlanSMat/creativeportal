Please talk to Caroline Donahue for clarification if needed. I'm away on a week annual leave from 14th - 20th Nov. back on 21st Nov. The files I've attached were created by our Brisbane team (Jane Blain) in Nov 2015 - you can get the files from her. Please keep the same logo design but update with the new Careers with SEEK brand colours.  For the trade M3x6 ad, please replace the CareerOne logo with the Careers with SEEK logo, and update all the colours to the Careers with SEEK brand colours. Also, in the trade ad please update the design, logo and colours in the mock tearsheet.  Once we have the design updated, we will supply new copy as well. Thank you.\r\nIncase my files don't upload, please ask Jane Blain from Creative in Brisbane for the following files:\r\nBig Start logo: 149_11-15_M86386_OTH_T2 M Big Start 2016 Logo revision_Cassandra Dalton\r\n(BIG START 2016 ONLY LOCKUP COLOUR version) and\r\nBig Start trade ad M3x6: 194_11-15_M86712_PRS_Big Start 2016 - Early Bird Trade Ads_Cassandra Dalton_M3x6","st_File_Upload":"","is_live_job_selected":"0","st_":"","form_prefix":"M","adnumber":"M1002412","current_date":"11\/11\/2016"}
