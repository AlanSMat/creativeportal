Tony agrees on us running with True colours. Can you provide us with a list of what you need for the shoot on Monday? \r\n\r\nFeedback from Tony is as follows:\r\n\r\nALL SHOW YOUR TRUE COLOURS VERSIONS\r\n1. Bring in a subhead around loyalty - so \"there's no loyalty in winning\" or something similar versus the statistics in the launch creative\r\n2. Move it under the headline\r\n3. INCREASE the Supercoach branding and move under subhead so the messaging works\r\n4. For the branding could we develop a device \"like the shield\" last year and pull that through under the headline \r\n4. Update Number one to #1\r\n\r\nOTEN Version\r\n1. Remove True Colours in header\r\n2. Move sunhead under headline\r\n3. Add SC Branding device\r\n4. Add OTEN to CTA so it reads OTEN TAFE COURSE\r\n5. Can you put the OTEN logo on the laptop like a sticker over the apple logo","st_File_Upload":"","is_live_job_selected":"0","st_":"","current_date":"12\/19\/2016"}
