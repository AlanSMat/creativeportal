We are looking to update the Manly Daily Home & Lifestyle guide (a commercial feature) to make it look more modern and premium, similar to the Summer Time mini-mag that has just been released across News Local. I have attached the existing Home & Lifestyle guide, which is six pages long. The additional five pages are inspiration for the new changes. I have outlined below some of the changes we would like made. Just ignore the advertising at the bottom of the guide, it's just the editorial design we are changing.\r\n\r\nPage 1 Cover (full page) - The cover page is largely to stay the same. Font type, colour and positioning of text can change if you have any ideas to make it feel more modern, stylish and premium.\r\nPage 2 Report (3\/4 page) - We want to replace this jumble of text and images with a clean, modern flat-lay as per the examples on page 7 and 8. Please change the title (November Report Monthly Round-up) to say \"The February Edit\"\r\nPage 3 Trends story (3\/4 page). Can we please just have a clean modern editorial story with a few large scale pictures, maybe some deep-etch as well. It should be more picture-heavy than it is currently. I have included an example on page 9 of the attachment. The editorial will be interior trends based, so on topics such as cactus, velvet, the pantone colour of the year etc.\r\nPage 4 & 5 Long story (2 x half pages). We want to scrap the Q&A style design and replace it with a picture heavy layout with little breakout boxes of text throughout, which will be used to draw attention to design elements in the pictures. It should look very magazine-y. I have attached an example on page 10, 11, 12.\r\nPage 6. Sponsored Content. This will be a commercial story, so just a general editorial layout that is clean and modern is perfect for this, similar to the trends piece on page 3 and example on page 9. If we could have a strap at the top that says \"Sponsored Content\" that would be perfect.\r\nThis is all to be made to the roughly the same specifications as the current Manly Daily Home & Lifestyle guide. Thanks so much - please let me know if you have any questions.
