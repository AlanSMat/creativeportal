They have asked to see their logo placement in situ before signing the sponsorship contract. So I really appreciate you doing this for us!\r\n\r\nI have attached three PDF with the suggested changes and the design files to match. Please don't hesitate to get in touch if you need anything else.\r\n\r\nWe were thinking due to their level of support they could get locked into the orange flag along with Channel 7 and Herald Sun. This would leave our other supporters in a row along the bottom.\r\n\r\nI just need City of Melbourne to stand out but on the same level as Channel 7 and Herald Sun but not attached to them - does that make sense?\r\n\r\n1. The facade on Clarendon Street\r\n2. The bulkhead inside the venue\r\n3. A Herald Sun 3 x 6 print ad&#8203;\r\n HS M3x6.indd&#8203;\r\n\r\nIf possible, it would be great to get the designs by COB Monday?\r\n\r\nThank you so much,\r\nYvette","st_File_Upload":"","is_live_job_selected":"0","st_":"","form_prefix":"M","adnumber":"M1003282","current_date":"12\/08\/2016"}
