Desk Talker - This details some hints and tips to help CSSR with their objection handling and do's and don'ts. If we need to change the dimension of the desk talker to fit the text, then let's do that. In terms of formatting, please feel free to use bold or bigger font to emphasis on heading etc... Also, I'll like to attach the USB to this creative instead of the A5 card.\r\n\r\n2. A5 card: This includes the staff incentives as part of the campaign\r\n\r\n3. A simply logo that reads 'Retention Blitz 2017'. This is for the cup cake.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, as these are all for use internally, we're happy for you to be creative around this... Any questions please let me know! :)\r\n\r\nCheers,","st_File_Upload":"","is_live_job_selected":"0","st_":"","form_prefix":"M","adnumber":"M1014392","current_date":"01\/25\/2017"}
