For the First 3 weeks we will be doing a Full Page for them to push the eating out aspect on these strips.  This just all came through yesterday so it is very last minute.  Alot of locals are going to Southland or alternate places and the aim of the campaign is to bring them back to the strip with a real local, community feeling advertisement about going to the cafe's and the restaurants locally.  A feeling that you can't get from shopping centres or outer areas.   Then I guess we could leave room to name the cafes and restaurants down the side (i've attached something bentleigh traders have done with shops down the side so maybe similar to that unless you have another idea which is totally fine).  If you have any questions please give me a call. 0412 030 802","st_File_Upload":"","is_live_job_selected":"0","st_":"","current_date":"11\/23\/2016"}
