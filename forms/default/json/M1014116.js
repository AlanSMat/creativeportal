The classic 'help us to help you' scenario. In order to make the day productive and action orientated, we would love to go to them with a few ideas\/examples of how we envision this working for 2017. Attached is the overriding brief for the day, with the deliverables for Creative Services included. I would love to book in a half hour to run through requirements and current creative examples.\r\nThe meeting is scheduled for the 9th of February, but we would ideally have material ready for a pre-read the week prior.","st_File_Upload":"","is_live_job_selected":"0","st_":"","current_date":"02\/01\/2017"}
