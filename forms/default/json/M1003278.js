On Sunday\r\n\r\nBody Copy:\r\nMatt Preston takes a look back on a year of gastronomic feats, reviewing the dishes, takeaway treats and cafe gems that have turned our heads and made us smile in 2016.\r\n\r\nImagery:\r\nOur Stellar Star with Matt Preston\r\n1 x food shot per state (see attached)\r\n\r\nLogos required:\r\ndelicious. on Sunday\r\ndelicious.100 (not the fork version)\r\nStellar\r\nSunday Masthead\r\n\r\nAs there are a LOT of brand logos here, so we need to be careful how we display them. It needs to be logical.\r\n\r\nFor instance, perhaps the d100 logo could sit next to the food image as a flash 'crowned a delicious.100 winner' and the restaurant name in italics (Coda, Bennelong, Gauge)\r\n\r\nThe Stellar and Masthead logos could sit as follows:\r\nAs seen in <Stellar Logo> only in <Masthead Logo>\r\n\r\nThe delicious. on Sunday logo would be included in the headline.\r\n\r\nThis may look TERRIBLE, so I will leave it to your creative flare, but the above is my suggestion.\r\n","st_File_Upload":"","is_live_job_selected":"0","st_":"","form_prefix":"M","adnumber":"M1003278","current_date":"12\/08\/2016"}
