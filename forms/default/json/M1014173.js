Perhaps let's get the look and feel confirmed before creating all the sizes?\r\nWe need three different messages.\r\nThey can all be the same look and feel. We like the look of the Cairns Post and NewsLocal ads attached. Can we do something similar with a red, white and black ad for Quest? They need to be really simple because they could be filling a tiny space in the paper.\r\n\r\nAD 1: SOCIAL\r\nHeadline: Get social with us\r\nCopy: Join the conversation on our social media channels\r\n(bold) Facebook, Instagram & Twitter\r\nQuest logo\r\n\r\nAD 2: FACEBOOK\r\nHeadline: \r\nCopy: Share the latest news with 80,000 of our Facebook fans\r\nQuest logo\r\nFineprint: Source: Facebook Insights, January 2017.\r\n\r\nAD 3: LOCAL CONVERSATION\r\nHeadline: Start a conversation with your community\r\nSmall Copy: Contact Quest Community News at newsqldadvertising@news.com.au or (07) 3666 6988\r\nQuest logo\r\n\r\n","st_File_Upload":"","is_live_job_selected":"0","st_":"","current_date":"02\/14\/2017"}
