Open to discussion on how to make this work.\r\nWill need a Powerpoint version we can give FSAM's and also an animated version Kris Yule can present with in person and talk to. \r\nWe also need an intro video (if possible) that will play prior to the presentation. If not, then those slides will also need to be part of the animated preso.\r\nMight be a good idea if we catch up together with Mark Power prior to starting. This is a major project with a lot of business focus\/attention","st_Creative_Details":"","whats_required":"Animated preso & intro video.\r\nOff the back of this I will also be briefing a one page double sided flyer and then later a media i screen.
