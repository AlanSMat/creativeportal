Very competitive market so need a point of difference through creative ads!  They have three levels that are different colours (yellow, red, green) so I thought It would look cool to create a full page ad using those different colours as building blocks (fun looking like lego!) as the main design with a simple message to book now... it looks like they are pushing on their website \"convenient self storage units\", \"security is key\" and \"flexible storage\" with bright red\/ yellow logo... I thought we could make something pretty fun, but creativity over to you!
