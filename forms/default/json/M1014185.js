This is suited to Blackburn and Bowen Hills. For Holt st, we want to create a similar effect, however using cutout stars (with the same content as the floor decals) that will be hung from the ceiling. We just need mock visuals at this point to get approvals from facilities and a costing. I have attached an image of the Blackburn Foyer. We are looking at creating a decal that is the same size as the tile, with approx 15 (depending on the space) unique decals. Each tile with have the Name, year they were a sports star, icon of their sport. I will supply a list. We'll also need a 'tile' that has the local sports stars logo, web address and #LocalSportsStars. We could have more than one of these used in the installation.\r\n\r\nFor the ceiling at Holt st, we would need a decent volume, pending the size of the stars.\r\n\r\nThese will need to be installed for launch on 6 March.","st_File_Upload":"","is_live_job_selected":"0","st_":"","form_prefix":"M","adnumber":"M1014185","current_date":"01\/19\/2017"}
