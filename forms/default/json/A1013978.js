I'm visiting a lapsed client who I've tried for the best part of a year to get in front of and hoping to use the creative in the Digital Workshop I'm presenting.\r\n\r\nAs your team have done for me before, I'm looking for an MREC ad unit creative for a job role for a Recruiter.\r\n\r\nI've attached a copy of a live job ad Chandler Macleod have on Seek and I'm hoping we can showcase how the MREC ad unit can be used to advertise their roles on our digital network.\r\n\r\nAs per usual, can you please build an MREC which showcases the role and a few bullet points about the role and a 'Apply Now' call to action.\r\n\r\nIf you can brand the MREC with the Chandler Macleod logo and use their colour scheme.\r\n\r\nI've attached the logo and the Seek ad in the zip file attached to this brief.\r\n\r\nAgain, sorry for the request for the quick turnaround.\r\n\r\nThanks as always!\r\n\r\nSteve","st_File_Upload":"","is_live_job_selected":"1","st_":"","form_prefix":"A","adnumber":"A1013978","current_date":"01\/16\/2017"}
