There are only 2 Harvey Norman Floorings stores in Adelaide and both are in the north. The gepps cross store can service the Southern Suburbs too. HV South stores are technically not allowed to advertised in other franchisees area. However, gepps cross store offers Floorings and Carpets which none of the South stores offers. So the client wants to put in ads in Southern times and Coast city.\r\n\r\nHowever, Gepps Cross store cannot advertise their RUGS which is part of the Floorings division since other stores do sell rugs.\r\n\r\nThe client has given an example of a full page advert (attached to this brief). This is just an example hence do not use store details from it. He is open to an artwork as we please. However, please follow the below guidelines.\r\n\r\n1. Do not mention RUGS as he will not be allowed to advertise that. Do not use any images that have RUGS.\r\n\r\n2. Put a blurb in the top right-hand corner which says 'Now Servicing The South. Please Call Harvey Norman Gepps Cross on 83428888 for a free measure and quote'.\r\n\r\n3. Please add in the advert - Interest-free terms available\r\n\r\n4. remove all details of the Shepparton store.\r\n\r\nWe can work on the attached artwork he has given OR work on a totally new one. The client just wants a good effective ad.\r\n\r\nplease call\/email me for any questions.\r\n","st_File_Upload":"","is_live_job_selected":"0","st_":"","form_prefix":"A","adnumber":"A1014109","current_date":"01\/18\/2017"}
