Please note the following -:\r\n\r\nTarek Boulos will be sending out the Leader EDM - I will just need to send all the necessary files to him once they have been created.  The send date for this one is 6\/3.\r\nThe Quest version will be sent via Mailchimp and this will be handled by our QLD marketing team.  Again, I will just need to forward the files to them for distribution.  Send date for this one will be wither w\/c 27\/2 or w\/c 6\/3.\r\nNewslocal - this one will be sent out in w\/c 20\/2.\r\n\r\nIf the creative can please follow the style and messaging of the attached M6x6 press version, that would be ideal.  Rather than be event specific however, please instead insert a link to the microsite - www.moneytalks.net.au \/ sydney, melb, etc.\r\nIf we can have a version that includes each market logo, we should otherwise be able to keep it quite generic hopefully.\r\nLet me know what else you need!  Thanks Jimmy!","st_File_Upload":"","is_live_job_selected":"0","st_":"","current_date":"01\/17\/2017"}
