The centre is undergoing a massive redevelopment in 2017.  We need a general branding ad made up for them to help with the perception that it is rundown so something that looks fresh and modern.  The branding ad will be adapted throughout the year to suit their marketing calendar (easter, mothers day etc.) and day to day marketing will be supported with a display and facebook digital campaign.  Attached it their logo and current branding.","st_File_Upload":"","is_live_job_selected":"1","st_":"","current_date":"12\/20\/2016"}
