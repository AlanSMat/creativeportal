This time the client is McArthur Management.\r\n\r\nThey are recruiting on behalf of Redland City Council so this ad unit will need to be co-branded please.\r\n\r\nI've attached a copy of the Redland City Council logo but I'm still waiting for a copy of the McArthur Management logo. For now if you can just build the ad with the RCC logo and we can add in the McArthur logo later on.\r\n\r\nI'd like the same style of ad unit as Sharon has done for me for Robert Walters. A scrolling ad with key bits of information.\r\n\r\nI've attached a copy of the job description but I think the top few points on that document should be enough for the ad.\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n\r\nJob title: General Manager Organisational Services\r\nOther key attributes: Genuine leadership role,\r\nExcellent financial package.\r\n\r\nIf you think there is anything else in that document attached that you could put in the ad please feel free to do so.\r\n\r\nIn terms of colour scheme, please use the McArthur Management colour scheme which is orange and white.\r\n\r\nThanks as always.\r\n\r\nSteve","st_File_Upload":"","is_live_job_selected":"1","st_":"","form_prefix":"A","adnumber":"A1013598","current_date":"12\/16\/2016"}
