I was hoping to use the same template for the ad and alter it to reflect these mining roles.\r\n\r\nRather than have the MREC ad as a rolling ad, for the purpose of this proposal I will need it to be a static ad instead please. \r\n\r\nFor the text of the ad can we please include something like 'Multiple Mining Opportunities Available' 'Bowen Basin Location' 'Apply Now'\r\n\r\nSomething along those lines.\r\n\r\nFor the mock print ad, I've attached a copy of an ad done by your team for the QLD Fire & Emergency campaign proposal for my colleague John Batzloff.\r\n\r\nJob number - A100906\r\n\r\nIf I was able to get something similar to this, with an image of a miner and similar text to the MREC 'Multiple Mining opportunities available now' 'Bowen Basin location'\r\n\r\nThen have the Chandler Macleod logo and BMA logo included as well.\r\n\r\nAgain, many apologies for the quick turnaround request. If it's possible to have something before COB tomorrow that would be amazing, but whatever you're able to do is more than appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks guys\r\n\r\nSteve","st_File_Upload":"","is_live_job_selected":"1","st_":"","form_prefix":"A","adnumber":"A1014279","current_date":"01\/24\/2017"}
