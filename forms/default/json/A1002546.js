In order to keep getting the fund, they need to maintain certain number of calls each year. The contracted number is 30,000 per year Australia wide. However, they received 20,000 - 25,000 calls last year and therefore, their budget has been slashed. Also, the government has introducted a new website - My Age Care (https:\/\/www.myagedcare.gov.au\/) and that contributed the decrease of calls to Alzheimer's Australia \/ National Dementia Helpline.\r\n\r\nTarget audience would be 50+, people with dementia, family or friends of dementia patients (who don't know how to deal with their family members with dementia or need help to diagnose dementia from their family members because most of the times, the people who has dementia themselves are in denial)\r\n\r\nBelow are the messages they want to put in the ad. We need strong Call to Action messages to get more calls. \r\n\r\nThere's a difference between forgetting where you left the house keys, and forgetting where you live.\r\n\r\nThere's a difference between forgetfulness and dementia.\r\n\r\nCall the National Dementia Helpline on 1800 100 500 and request a FREE dementia kit.\r\n\r\nThe client also mentioned that 'Click to Call' or 'Request a FREE Dementia Kit' buttons must be big enough to get attention. Please use Teal Colour to emphasise on the message.","st_File_Upload":"","is_live_job_selected":"1","st_":"","current_date":"11\/29\/2016"}
