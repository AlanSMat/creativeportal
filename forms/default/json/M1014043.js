It\\'s essentially a document I\\'m presenting to the editorial teams so we need it to look impressive :)\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that there are some slides which we will need to update first thing on Thursday (before the meeting) as the creative will have changed. However this will simply be swapping out imagery within the slide.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth attachments are over 5mb, so I will e-mail these directly to Karina\r\n\r\n\r\nAny questions please let me know\r\n","st_File_Upload":"","is_live_job_selected":"0","st_":"","form_prefix":"M","adnumber":"M1014043","current_date":"01\/17\/2017"}
