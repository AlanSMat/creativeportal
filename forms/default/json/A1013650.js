I've attached a copy of the tear sheet for that last ad.\r\n\r\nThey would like to use the same style and format but reduce the size of the ad this time.\r\n\r\nThey are looking for a 9x3 col cm ad for the Careers section. This is 90mm H x 97mm W.\r\n\r\nI've attached the copy of Drake's logo as well as their client's logo which also needs to be included in the ad as was in the last ad.\r\n\r\nI've also attached a word document with the text that needs to be included into the ad.\r\n\r\nIf you can please build the ad to the specs provided and in the same format as last time.\r\n\r\nThanks as always.\r\n\r\nSteve","st_File_Upload":"","is_live_job_selected":"0","st_":"","form_prefix":"A","adnumber":"A1013650","current_date":"12\/19\/2016"}
