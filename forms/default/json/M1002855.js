I\\'m leading content development.\r\n\r\n\\'Path To Purchase\\' is a concept that is utilised widely now in our business. It is a way of illustrating how our media can influence decisions prior to purchase, right up until purchase.\r\n\r\nThe booklet will target business owners, but also serve as a consultation platform to help FSAMs with diagnostic conversations.\r\n\r\nThis project is fairly big. So the due date I\\'ve supplied here is really just punched in because it is a mandatory field. We\\'ll work on it through stages. The first bit of content I supply (not attached here) can be used to develop a style that will run through the whole project.\r\n\r\nCustomer Solutions will present this to the sales team in a Monday morning presentation, and we\\'ll need creative support for that presentation.","st_File_Upload":"","is_live_job_selected":"0","st_":"","form_prefix":"M","adnumber":"M1002855","current_date":"11\/25\/2016"}
