Jane recently constructed a co-branded flyer called 'Digital Talent Search' for my client Walker Andersen. I've attached the job number for that creative to this brief.\r\n\r\nI pretty much need the exact same flyer but with the Robert Walters logo and colour scheme instead.\r\nOn page 1 of the flyer everything can remain the same as the previous flyer except two small things: 1) The Robert Walters logo to replace the Walker Andersen Logo and 2) The Robert Walters MREC to replace the Walker Andersen MREC in the image. I've attached a copy of the Robert Walters logo in the file uploaded.\r\n\r\nOn the second page I want to keep pretty much the same format but the Robert Walters packages are again custom packages so I've attached a copy of a mock flyer that I created just for content purposes. If you can take the info that's in that table and put it in a Robert Walters colour schemed table that would be fantastic.\r\n\r\nThe final two changes I need made 1) Get rid of the text about the 10% discount, not needed for this flyer.\r\n2) Can we please include the 'Featured Careers' listing example in the flyer somewhere, maybe on the second page? I need it to look the same format as it appears online. I've included an example on the mock flyer I've attached.\r\n\r\nHopefully that all makes sense.\r\n\r\nThanks as always!","st_File_Upload":"","is_live_job_selected":"1","st_":"","current_date":"11\/25\/2016"}
