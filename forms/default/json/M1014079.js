Header image to come, please use a placeholder for now. Can we please get a mock up in PDF so we can run through approvals before building in HTML. Copy is still going through final approvals so may need to drop new copy in once we start building the HTML.\r\n\r\nWe will also need static benie placements in 650x40, 650x220, 315x90. Copy to come.\r\n\r\nWe are tight on timing for this one so if we could get the PDF mock up by COB Fri and aim to finalise the HTML by next Wednesday that would be great. Let me know if you see any issues with the timing.","st_File_Upload":"","is_live_job_selected":"0","st_":"","form_prefix":"M","adnumber":"M1014079","current_date":"01\/18\/2017"}
