I have put red boxes to show which ones i am referring to as well as the logo without for your reference.Inline images 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInline images 2\r\n\r\nPlease see attached brochure changes. Rachael is adding a second Financial Dimension page for the second team and I will forward to you to insert in between page 7 and 8.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help.","st_File_Upload":"","is_live_job_selected":"0","st_":"","current_date":"12\/06\/2016"}
