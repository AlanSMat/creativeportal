I'm just after a copy of the Barn Doors you already had mocked up for Infiniti Brighton, the ones you and George were originally going to include in the Drive-Away magazine.\r\n\r\nThe client is now churned and we are meeting with the group next Thursday to discuss the new stock and some different creative options. \r\n\r\nI'm just wanting to take the Barn Doors you originally mocked up and tweak it to get a mock up of the below: \r\n\r\n-Option 6 4pp Full Width,Short 2\/3 wrap 115gsm A2 Gloss\r\n- Option 7 4pp Full Width, Short 1\/2 wrap 115gsm A2 Gloss\r\n- Barn Doors\r\n- Embedded Ad Note and Front Page Strip \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if it's not as simple as I'm thinking to reuse the original mock up, cause if worse comes to worse I can just present the Barn Doors as is too. \r\nGive me whenever you need :) \r\nBernice - 0433533349\r\n\r\nCheers","st_File_Upload":"","is_live_job_selected":"0","st_":"","form_prefix":"A","adnumber":"A1002258","current_date":"11\/08\/2016"}
