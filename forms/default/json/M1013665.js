Move all of the ads to the same new job number so that they are all in the one location.\r\n2. Ensure the Quest logo is updated on all ads\r\n3. Ensure all staff have the same suite of sizes on hand. If not, can you please create the sizes required for the staff member?\r\n4. Ensure the photo is an official headshot with a white background. If not, can you please make a list of those staff who have incorrect photos so that we can get their photo taken.\r\n5. Can you please also design a Christmas themed ad template and an EOFY themed ad template? We might try to include them next year.\r\n\r\nThe ongoing process for new staff will be for the manager to send contact details and a headshot to your team. A new ad will be created under the same job number for the staff member.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nSarah","st_File_Upload":"","is_live_job_selected":"0","st_":"","form_prefix":"M","adnumber":"M1013665","current_date":"12\/20\/2016"}
